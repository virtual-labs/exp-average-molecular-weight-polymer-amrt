      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Thermosets undergo irreversible chemical changes during curing and cannot be remelted.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Thermoplastics can be reheated and reshaped.",
        "c": "Partially true, but some elastomers can be reused in limited ways.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Some polymers are recyclable."

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Strength varies among polymer types.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Elastomers are flexible but not the strongest.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Thermoplastics are moderately strong but not the strongest.",
        "d": "Correct. Thermosets have high cross-linking, making them mechanically strong and heat resistant."

      "question": "Elastic deformation in polymers is due to _____________.",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Severing of Covalent bonds",
        "b": "Straightening of molecular chains",
        "c": "Slight adjustment of molecular chains",
        "d": "Slippage of molecular chains"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Severing bonds causes permanent deformation, not elastic.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Straightening implies larger deformation than elastic.",
        "c": "Correct. Elastic deformation occurs due to small, reversible adjustments in molecular chains.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Slippage indicates plastic deformation."
